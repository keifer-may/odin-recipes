    <h2>Description</h2>
    <em><p>I love a nice bowl of chili. My wife loves it in the right season, but I could eat it all year round. In fact, I've been known to eat it for 3 meals a day for stretches if she'll let me.</p></em>
    <br>

        <li>2 (16 ounce) cans dark red kidney beans (such as Bush's®)</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>

    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, bell pepper, Anaheim pepper, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until softened. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; add Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. Crumble bouillon cubes over beef and add beer. Continue to cook , scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until liquid is hot, about 3 minutes. Stir beef mixture into pepper mixture. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and wine to the beef mixture. Season with chili powder, 2 tablespoons cumin, brown sugar, pepper sauce, basil, paprika, salt, oregano, and black pepper. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until meat and vegetables are very tender and flavors have developed in the chili, about 90 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix kidney beans into beef and vegetables. Continue to simmer until beans are hot, about 30 minutes more. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Blend sour cream, cilantro, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin in a food processor until smooth. Serve sour cream mixture with chili. 
        </li>
    </ol>
